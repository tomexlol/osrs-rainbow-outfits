# osrs-rainbow-outfits
generate color themed outfits for OSRS


load_items: makes subfolders with icons for every slot
generate_hues_by_slot: gives you a json with things separated by color (very roughly) by slot
setgenerator.html: play with the beta set generator


single_hue: can analyze 1 single icon at a time, was used for debugging & tuning the color detection algorithm


todo: actually display icons+names on the html instead of raw json lol


not used but included because idk: generate_set generates a set according to hue given. same logic but in javascript is used in setgenerator.html
